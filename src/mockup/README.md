# Instructions

You need to create mocks for the given app (see below). The mock should use [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) / Zeplin / something similar. You are supposed to put pictures / screenshots of your mocks along with your project files. The mocks have to cover every view your application can have and edge case that you can think of. You are not supposed to **write any code** for this task. We just need the screenshot of your design mocks.

Some of the points below are written from the perspective of a complete application, for example Point 7. You can ignore them for the purposes of this mocks.

- Put your screenshot (along with any relevant project files) in the `mockup` folder.
- Ensure your mocks are for desktop and mobile as well.
- If you want to extend the feature, be sure to include your idea in the mocks.
- Be as detailed as possible.
- The mocks can include color info as well but it's not requried at this stage.
